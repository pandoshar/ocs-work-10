four homework exercises
so basically i have done four homework exercises.
first one was about counting money in canteen. It wasn't hard at all, the only thing i had to think about was converting tyiyn to som;
second one was about finding a lucky number. It wasn't hard i just had to use / and %;
third one was about using for. It is the easiest;
fourth one was about finding a prime number. I had to make a function called isPrime() which had to check if number is prime(how suprising) or not than i used while and added +1 if isPrime == false
